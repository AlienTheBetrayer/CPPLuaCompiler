This program can compile Lua code in a C++ console window.![Compiler screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/zt5bpNg.png)
## Features
### Realtime console window name changes
The console changes it's title when something happens in your code.
### Syntax highlighting
As you can see in the picture, the code within the file is being read and has some syntax highlighting in it.
### Function redirecting
The compiler redirects **print()** and **warn()** functions to it's own, giving it prefixes like **[PRINT]** or **[WARN]**.
### File explorer
As soon as you start the program the file explorer will show up, you will have to choose the **.lua** file, and the compiler will run the script.
### Error thrower
The compiler will tell you, if you did any mistake in your code.
